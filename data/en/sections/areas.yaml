- name: "Hybrid heterostructures"
  # logo: 
  summary: "My main interest is studying nanoelectronic devices composed of different materials, like superconductors, semiconductors, and magnetic materials. These heterostructures allow achieving properties not available in nature, like topological excitations."

- name: "Superconducting qubits"
  # logo: 
  summary: "I study superconducting circuits to implement quantum information processing. In particular, I study heterogeneous quantum architecture that mixes different types of superconducting qubits to leverage their strengths."

- name: "Vortex nucleation"
 # logo: 
  summary: "The nucleation of vortices in superconductors is an example of a rare event. The frequency of these events is determined by the energy barrier experienced by vortices while crossing the sample boundary. We developed numerical methods to assess the potential landscape of vortices in both conventional and unconventional superconductors."
