# a summary about you
summary: 'My area of research is at the boundary of condensed matter physics and quantum information.
          In particular I specialized in quantum nanoelectronic and superconducting heterostructures, 
          where superconductive material are combined with semiconductors and magnets to generate and 
          control new behavrios not found in nature.'
