Multiterminal Josephson Effects with Floquet Scattering Matrices Josephson junctions are fundamental components in the realm of superconducting quantum electronics and quantum computing, primarily due to the DC Josephson effect, which produces the nonlinear inductance necessary for qubit operation.\nThe AC Josephson effect, a dynamic counterpart of the DC effect, occurs when a finite voltage applied to a junction induces an alternating current (AC). The mechanisms underlying the AC Josephson effect are less straightforward compared to those of the DC Josephson effect, resulting in a theory that is not easily generalizable.\nThis project aims to reformulate the theory of the Josephson effects by utilizing Floquet scattering matrices. This novel approach is expected to yield a simpler, more generalizable framework. Initially, we will develop a foundational model using these matrices to understand the simple case of a normal junction. Subsequently, the model will be applied to analyze junctions constructed from unconventional materials, multiterminal junctions, and finally general superconducting circuits.\nThe successful execution of this project could lead to significant advancements in the understanding and application of Josephson junctions in quantum technologies. The expected duration is one academic year and is aimed at writing a paper. The project may include a strong numerical part depending on the direction we choose to follow.\nWhat you can expect from this project:\nAn extensive introduction to superconductor nanoelectronics. Learn the language of Floquet scattering matrices for the description of quantum transport. Understand how to develop a new method for a known problem, and how to apply a known method to a new unknown problem.

Vortices in Altermagnetic Superconductors Altermagnets are a newly discovered form of magnetic order, similar to antiferromagnets, that do not preserve Kramers degeneracy and show staggered magnetism both in real-space and in momentum-space. After being proposed theoretically, signatures of altermagnetism have been observed in some oxides.\nBecause of this peculiar spin-split band structure, altermagnetism holds the promise of new intriguing phenomena when put in contact with superconductors. Can we create synthetic unconventional superconducting pairing by combining these two materials? Can we use altermagnetism as a new tool in synthetic topological quantum matter?\nIn this project, you will try to answer these questions. In particular, we will focus on magnetic vortices in altermagnetic superconductors. The project will be mainly numerical; we will develop a Bogoliubov-De Gennes (BdG) model and study tight-binding simulations.\nWhat you can expect from this project:\nDevelop a thorough understanding of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) methods, exact diagonalization techniques, and the Kernel Polynomial Method.

The Usadel equations are a powerful model for describing diffusive superconductors. These equations are particularly efficient for modeling inhomogeneous systems out of equilibrium, including effects of magnetism and spin-orbit coupling, while remaining computationally affordable. This makes them an ideal framework for studying mesoscopic superconducting devices.\nIn a previous project, I developed pyUsadel, a Python package designed to solve 2D problems in equilibrium settings. For future work, we aim to rewrite the package within a finite-element framework. This will allow us to handle more complex geometries and extend the tool\u0026rsquo;s capabilities to support multicomponent superconductors and non-equilibrium setups. An improved tool could significantly benefit the development of superconducting quantum devices.\nThis project not only aims to advance the computational tools available for studying superconducting systems but also provides a comprehensive learning experience in computational physics, software engineering, and high-performance computing.\nWhat you can expect from this project:\nDevelop a deep understanding of the Usadel equations and their significance in the study of superconductors. Learn and apply Finite Element Modeling techniques to solve complex differential equations. Gain experience in scientific computing and software development, focusing on efficiency and extensibility.
